# :fire: 8-Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) using **MS SQL Server.** 

>[!Note]
**The case studies are not yet finished.** I am currently working on them and will upload the solutions as I complete each one. Stay tuned!

The 8-Week SQL Challenge, created by Danny Ma, is highly recommended for SQL enthusiasts and aspiring data analysts. He has put together 8 interesting case studies that focus on hands-on problem solving and encourage thinking outside the box.  It's a fun and engaging way to tackle various questions. Enjoy the challenge as much as I do!

Thanks @DataWithDanny for interesting SQL case studies! :wave:🏻

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.
Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

    The following topics are covered in Danny’s Diner case study:
    
    1. Common Table Expressions
    2. Group By Aggregates
    3. Window Functions for ranking
    4. Table Joins

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

    The following topics are covered in Pizza Runner's case study:
    
    1. Common table expressions
    2. Group by aggregates
    3. Table joins
    4. String transformations
    5. Dealing with null values
    6. Regular expressions
